        I started working on this project recently, my goal is to make fully working osu client by next year.
        Right now, only main menu and song select works I added a video here
        <br>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEew97wfAd8?si=OOaFYqZOG9iIyLRE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br>
        

    As you see it's (somewhat) broken, but yeah, its made in js and html but it can only run at 360x480 due to some technical limitations, the visualizer doesn't follow the song for now because again... technical limitations.
    I'm gonna go back to code, see you! o/
